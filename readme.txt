AI and Plagiarism Detection System:

This project is built using BERT and transformer-based techniques to classify uploaded text content into four categories:
1. AI-Generated
2. Humanized-AI
3. Plagiarized
4. Original

The model supports file uploads in .txt, .pdf, and .docx formats, reads the content, and returns a classification along with a confidence score. A Gradio-based UI is used to interact with the model.

Evaluation graphs for precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix are displayed after simulated prediction metrics.

For detailed usage, installation, and outputs, refer to the readme.txt
